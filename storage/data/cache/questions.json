    "options": {
      "A": "The femoral vein is lateral to the femoral artery at the base of the triangle.",
      "B": "The femoral vein is anterior to the femoral artery throughout the triangle.",
      "C": "The femoral vein is medial to the femoral artery at the base of the triangle and posteromedial at the apex.",
      "D": "The femoral vein is posterior to the femoral artery only at the apex of the triangle."
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "**Why \"The femoral vein is medial to the femoral artery at the base of the triangle and posteromedial at the apex.\" is the correct answer:**\nIn the femoral triangle, the femoral vein is positioned medial to the femoral artery at the base and shifts to a posteromedial position at the apex. This orientation is crucial for understanding vascular relationships in the thigh.\n\n**Analysis of Other Options:**\n- Option A (The femoral vein is lateral to the femoral artery at the base of the triangle.): Incorrect because the femoral vein is medial, not lateral, to the femoral artery at the base.\n- Option B (The femoral vein is anterior to the femoral artery throughout the triangle.): Incorrect because the vein is not anterior, but rather medial and then posteromedial to the artery.\n- Option D (The femoral vein is posterior to the femoral artery only at the apex of the triangle.): Incorrect because the vein is medial to the artery at the base, not just posterior at the apex.\n\n**Clinical Context:**\nKnowledge of the femoral artery and vein's anatomical relationship is essential during surgical procedures and catheterizations in the femoral region to avoid vascular injury.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\nIn the femoral triangle, the femoral vein is medial to the artery at the base and moves to a posteromedial position at the apex.",

    "explanation": "**Why \"Medial border of sartorius muscle\" is the correct answer:**\nThe lateral boundary of the femoral triangle is formed by the medial border of the sartorius muscle. The sartorius is a long, thin muscle that runs across the thigh from the hip to the knee and is a key landmark in defining the lateral aspect of this anatomical region.\n\n**Analysis of Other Options:**\n- Option A (Inguinal ligament): The inguinal ligament forms the base (superior boundary) of the femoral triangle, not the lateral boundary.\n- Option B (Adductor longus): The adductor longus forms the medial boundary of the femoral triangle, not the lateral.\n- Option D (Pectineus): The pectineus muscle is located within the floor of the femoral triangle and does not contribute to its lateral boundary.\n\n**Clinical Context:**\nUnderstanding the boundaries of the femoral triangle is crucial for procedures such as catheterization or identifying the location of the femoral artery, vein, and nerve during surgery. Accurate anatomical knowledge helps prevent complications.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\nThe medial border of the sartorius muscle forms the lateral boundary of the femoral triangle.",
